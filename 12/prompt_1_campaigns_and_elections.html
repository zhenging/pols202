<li>Describe the three distinct stages of presidential campaigns. Offer examples. Review the relationship of national parties and states when deciding primary election calendars.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Part 1: Response</h4>
<p>Presidential campaigns involve three distinct stages. First, the nominating process, in which each party chooses its contender, is often drawn out over years of campaigning followed by some six months of state-by-state primary elections. Second, the two major party conventions take place during later summer of an election year. Finnaly, the general election features the final battle for the White House and kicks off in earnest after the conventions.<br />
Each state determines its own primary election date through negotiation with the national parties. Every four years, states jockey to schedule their balloting near the front of the line. Holding a primary early in the process, before the nomination is decided, attract attention - and giver the voters an important say in selecting the nominee. Back in 1922, the national party leaders scheduled multiple elections on a single date, known as Super Tuesday, hoping to keep the contest from dragging out too long.</p>
<h4>Part 2: Application</h4>
<p>Poll: Clinton and Trump Now Tied as GOP Convention Kicks Off<br />
https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/data-points/poll-clinton-trump-now-tied-gop-convention-kicks-n611936<br />
According to a report from NBC News during 2016 election, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are virtually tied in the polls as the Republican National Convention convenes in Cleveland. Clinton's 3-point lead slightly dropped to 1-point, down to 46 percent to 45 percent.<br />
Political party conventions showcase the party's presidential nominee on a national stage. When the it work well, the convention can provide the nominee an electoral bounce, a boost in the pools that lasts from a few days to several weeks. During the 2016 campaigns, Hillary Clinton and the Democrats got a much higher (and longer lasting) bounce from their convention than Donald Trump and the Republicans.</p>
