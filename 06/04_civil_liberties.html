Chapter 4: Civil Liberties</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Civil rights</strong>: The limits placed on government so that people can freely exercise their rights.</p>
<h3>The Rise of Civil Liberties</h3>
<h4>Civil Rights and Civil Liberties</h4>
<p>Civil Rights and liberties demand <strong>opposite</strong> things from government. Civil rights <strong>require</strong> government action to help secure individual rights; civil liberties <strong>restrict</strong> government action to protect individual rights..</p>
<h4>The Slow Rise of Rights</h4>
<ul>
<li><em>Selective incorporation</em>. Extending protection from the Bill of Rights to the state government, one right at a time.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Privacy</h3>
<h4>Penumbras and Emanations</h4>
<p>How could the Court protect privacy if the Constitution does not even mention it?</p>
<ul>
<li>in the Bill of Rights &quot;have penumbras ...&quot; that give them life and substance.</li>
<li>The <em>penumbras</em> - literally, the shadows - of the First Amendments create &quot;zone of privacy&quot; in which people have a right to make their own choices from government interference. So do the &quot;emanations&quot; from other amendmentss. such as the Third Amendment's ban on quartering soliders in private homes</li>
</ul>
<h4>Roe v. Wade</h4>
<h4>Planned Parenthood v. Casey</h4>
<h4>Sexuality Beteen Consenting Adults</h4>
<h3>Freedom of Religion</h3>
<p>The First Amendment gives two succinct commands regulating religion. The federal government may not establish an official religion-known as the <strong>establishment clause</strong>. And it may not interfere in the religious practice-the <strong>free exercise clause</strong>.</p>
<h4>Establishment Clause</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Strict seperation</strong>: The strict principles articulated in the <em>Lemon test</em> for judging whether a law establishes a religion.</li>
<li><strong>Acommodation</strong>: The principle that government does not violate the establishment clause as long as it does not confer an advantage to some religion over others.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Free Exercise Clause</h4>
<p><em>neutrality test</em><br />
<em>Sherbert or balancing test</em></p>
<h3>Freedom of Speech</h3>
<p>The First Amendment states: <em>Congress shall make no laws ... abridging the freedom of speech or of the press.</em></p>
<h4>A Preferrred Position</h4>
<ul>
<li>The Supreme Court givers the First Amendment a &quot;prefered position&quot; among all the amendments to the Constitution.</li>
<li>Among the rights listed in the First Amendment(free speech, religion, press, assembly, and the right to petition government), free speech holds a &quot;prefered position.&quot;</li>
<li>Democracy requires vigorous debate. As a resultm the courts will be skeptical of any effort to curb speech.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Political Speech</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/1900-1940/249us47"><em>Schencks v. United State, 1919</em></a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Speech is not protected if it poses a &quot;<em>clear and present danger</em>&quot; that it will lead to substantive evil.</li>
<li>The Court held that the Espionage Act did not violate the First Amendment and was an appropriate exercise of Congress’ wartime authority.</li>
<li><strong>Clear and present danger</strong>. Court doctrine that permits restrictions of free speech if officials believe that the speech will lead to prohibited action such as violence or terrorism.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/1968/492"><em>Branndenburg v. Ohio (1969)</em></a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Court's Per Curiam opinion held that the Ohio law violated Brandenburg's right to free speech.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Symbolic Speech</h4>
<p><strong>Symbolic Speech</strong>: An act, rather than actual speech, used to demonstrate a point of view.</p>
<p>E.g. KKK Leader Clarence Brandenburg burned his cross.</p>
<h4>Limits to Free Speech: Fighting Words</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fighting words</strong>: Expressions inherently likely to provoke violent reaction and not necessarily protected by the First Amendment.</li>
<li><strong>Hate Speech</strong>: Hostile statements based on someone's personal characteristics, such as race, ethnicity, religion, or sexual orientation.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Limited Protections: Student Speech</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/1968/21">Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District</a></p>
<ul>
<li>The Supreme Court overturned the suspension and established what became knowns as the Tinker Rule: The students' right to free speech could be curtailed only if it &quot;materially and substantially&quot; interferes with the requirements of appropriate discipline in the operation of the school.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/2006/06-278">Morse v. Frederick</a></p>
<ul>
<li>The First Amendment offers students-in high schools or colleges-less protection than adults. School officials may regulate speech as long as they do not do so arbitrarily.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Freedom of the Press</h3>
<h4>Prior Restraint</h4>
<ul>
<li>Prior Restraint: Legal effort to stop speech before it occurs-in effect, censorship.</li>
<li>Obscenity</li>
<li>Libel (written falsehood are known as <em>libel</em>, spoken falsehood are known as <em>slander</em>)</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Right to Bear Arms</h3>
<ul>
<li>A Relic of the Revolution</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Rights of the Accused</h3>
<h3>Fightling Terrorism and Protecting Liberty</h3>
<h3>Conclusion: The Dilemma of Civil Liberties</h3>
