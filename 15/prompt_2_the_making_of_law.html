<p>What is the purpose of committees and subcommittee hearings; what is the purpose of Conference Committee? Discuss the reasoning behind having so many steps for making a law. How does Congress represent the founders' intent to provide for a series of checks and balances? Do you think the system works? why/why not? Should it be easier to pass laws through Congress? What, if any, benefits do the checks and balances provide?</p>
<h4>Part 1: Response</h4>
<p>Once a bill is submitted to the Speaker's office, it will be assigned a number and referred to committee with autority (or jurisdication) over the area affected by the proposed bill. Holding hearings on the policy topic is one of the four major task performed by the committee. The committee hearing is a way for committee to gather information as legislation policymaking gets underway. Hearings usually feature wittness, who submit testimony, make an oral presentation, and answer questions from members of Congress (MK, 346). The subcommittee hearing functions in the similar way.<br />
The Conference Committee is a tempory collection of House and Senante members appointed to workout a compromise version of legislation that passed both chambers in different forms(MK, 350).<br />
The reason behind having so many steps for making a law is legislation is the central act of US domestic government and important laws have far-reaching consequeneces.<br />
Congress is bicameral and comprises two houses, the House of Representatives and the Senate. The House of Representatives wields centralized control through a powerful leadership team and can move swiftly on national legislative priorities(MK, 328). When it comes to the Senate, each senator possesses a remarkable degree of autonomy and are independent(MK, 329).<br />
I think the system works. The House makes the government responsive and the Senate ensures stability.</p>
<h4>Part 2: Application</h4>

The Senate Intelligence Committee's hearing on foreign use of social media to influence US politics took place Wednesday morning with two of the big tech companies that senators wanted to hear from present and one empty chair. This is a scenario where a committee with authority carris out one of its four major tasks,  holding public hearings on policy topic. In this case, the Senate Intelligence Committee has the authority over the areas of social media. The wittnesses are the CEOs of the big tech companies. They are supposed to give testimony on what the committee are concerned about. The hearing is an important link in the whole law making process. It will decide whether the proposed bill should proceed or not.</p>
