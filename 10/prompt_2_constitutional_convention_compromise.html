Answer the following prompt in 3 robust paragraphs: Using the lecture material, explore the central components of the major debates and compromises made at the Constitutional Convention of 1787 and make an application to current events today. A quality essay will have a clear thesis and will address the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Describe the basic underpinnings of the Electoral College and the framers' concerns. Offer an analysis of how the electoral college helped alleviate concerns held by the framers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Describe and explain the differences between the Virginia Plan and the New Jersey Plan. Offer an analysis of the Compromise that was eventually reached.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using the current events discussed in our discussions&quot;, or current events you're following in major news sources, draw parallels and significance to today for one of the compromises (Electoral College or Connecticut Compromise). Make a clear connection to your current event and one of the compromises discussed in your response.</p>

<h4>Response</h4>
<p>The Constitution framers saw problems with every option when it comes to choose the president. If the state legislatures were allowed to vote for the president, the framers did not trust state legislatures could put aside their own narrow concerns and think about the national interest. If the president were to voted directly by the people, the framers thought the people didn't have enough information or wisdom to make choice wisely. Then they came up with the Electoral College, which is the system established by the Constitution to elect the president; each state has a group of electors (equal in size to that of its congressional delegation in the House and the Senate); the public in each state votes for electors who then vote for the president. The electors are individuals selected by each state with sound judgement and could make a wise choice for president. In doing that, neither the state legislature nor the people directly voted for the president. But their will were still represented through the electors' votes.<br />
Among the differences between the Virginia Plan and the New Jersey Plan, the first one is about the legislature structure. The Virginia Plan favored a bicameral legislature(meaning the congress would have two chambers) and the representation in both chambers were based on the state population. while the New Jersey Plan wanted a unicameral legislature (meaning the congress would have only one chamber) and each state have one vote in Congress, regardless of its size. Second, how to elect the legislature body. The Virginia Plans called for the citizens to vote for the members of the House of Representatives, the number of which would reflect the size of the state, The House of Representatives would in turn vote for senator provided by the state legislature. According to the New Jersey Plan, each state have the same numbers of representation in Congress, meaning equal votes for each state. Third, for the executive body, the Virginia Plan didn't specify whether the president would be one man or a committee; nor did it say how long the executive would serve. The New Jersey Plan said a committee would be elected by the Congress to serve as the federal executive for one term only. To break the deadlock, a compromise was brokered. According to the compromise, the House of Representatives would be based on population, the Senate would have two representatives for each state, chosen by the state legislature. Because legislation has to pass through both houses, the public and the states would each have a say.<br />
In a recent report from CNBC, the Democratic-held House passes the most significant gun legislation to go through Congress in 20 years(Jacob Pramuk, 2019). Even with 92 percent of Americans who favored background checks for all gun sales, the bill will still likely not get through the GOP-controlled Senate. This is an example of how a piece of typical legislation is passed or not passed. The legislation has to go through both Houses. Both housed have to agree on the legislation for it to pass. In this case, the upper house- Senate decided not to let the gun check bill through. That reflects how the system was designed in the new Constitution when the Virginia Planners and the New Jersey Planners reached compromises. Though the people(House of Representatives) favored gun sale background check, the states (represented on the Senate)say no.</p>
