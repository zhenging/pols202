<h4>Article of Confederation</h4>
<p>The U.S. government is a constitutional government, which means its governing is based on the fundamental law - the Constitution. However, the current constitution is not the first constitution. When the Unite States declared its independence to the world in 1770s, thirtheen states formed a confederation and ratified the first constitution - the Articles of Confederaion.<br />
Confederaion is a loose association in which all member states yield some of their power to a central government and still retain a degree of sovereign authority. The Articles of Confederaion were designed to keep the central government weak, because the Continental Congress feared a powerful central government would strip the people of their rights, like what the Britain did to their colonies. On the other hand, the famous domestic disturbance such as Shay's Rebellion proved a weak central government like the one formed by Articles of Confederaion was too weak to protect people's rights.<br />
In the wake of Shay's Rebellion and other spreading chaos, a constitutional convention was called to revise the Articles of Confederaion. However, the delegates decided to discard the Articles of Confederaion and create a new government. James Madison, the father of the US Constitution, came with the plan that the new government took the power and vested it in a strong national government. After lively debates and various compromises, the new Constitution finally went to the states to be ratified. Both supporters of the new Constitution-known as Federalists and the opponents-known as the Anti-Federalist rallied respectively to their own course. Together, Alexander Hamilton, James Madison and Jahn Jay wrote totally 85 essays, which became known as The Federalist Papers, to explain and defent the new Constitution. Along with the Federalist Papers, a variety of Anti-Federlists wrote a number of papers-known as the Anti-Federalist Papers to argue against the new Constitution. In the following sections, both the Federalist Papers and the Anti-Federalist Papers will be discussed, and a brief anylysis of why the argument of the Federalists was a better prediction of the future will also be followed.</p>
<h3>Summary I: Federalist Papers</h3>
<p>Federalist Paper No.1 is an introduction to all other Federalist Papers. In the paper, the author-Hamilton appealed to the people of the United States to deliberate on a new constitution. He first pointed out that people were disappointed with the former government, as he put it, &quot;an unequivocal experience of the inefficiency of the subsisting federal government&quot; (Hamilton, Federalist Paper No.1). The series of papers were intended to persuade the states to ratify the new Constitution, so it is important to emphasize the failure of the government formed under the older Constitution.<br />
The consent of the governed refers to the idea that the authority of a government should depend on the consent of the people. It contrasts to divine rights of kings. As former colonies of the Britain, the United States had always been easily exploited and had their rights stripped away. In founding a new government, the Americans valued the independence most and were desperated to establish a government that can represent their own will and govern only with the consent of people.<br />
Hamilton believed that societies of men were capable of establishing a good government through reflection and choice. Alarmed by the domestic threats such as Shay's Rebellion, the people of the United Stated realized that the central government should be given more power to maintain public order. When the choice to form a new government system by ratifing the new Constitution emerges, it is natural that people go for that course.<br />
In Federalist Paper No.84, Hamilton endeavored to answer some of the objections of the new Contitution. Three main objections are addressed. The first one is that opposers claimed that the Constituion contains no bill of rights. Hamilton laid out three points to counter the argument.</p>
<ol>
<li>The Consitution contains various provisions in favor of paricular privileges and rights. It also fully adopts the common law of Great Britain. Many other rights not expressed in it are equally secured.</li>
<li>The common and state law by the Constitution are subject to alteration.</li>
<li>A minute detail of particular rights is note applicable to the Constitution.</li>
<li>The bill of rights would contains exceptions to powers not granted and be dangerous.</li>
<li>The constituion itself is a bill of rights.<br />
The second objection is that it is improper to confer such large powers upon the national government. Hamilton's Counterarguments were</li>
<li>The power is vested in the Union.</li>
<li>Three branches of the government will hold each other in check.<br />
The last important objection is that the adoption of the new government would occasion a considerable increase of expense. Hamilton argued that 1</li>
<li>Different organization of the federal government rather than a single body are required. It's impossible to support these organization without any expense.</li>
<li>There is no reason to believe that the number or salaries of the new government will be greater than those of the former.</li>
<li>The extra business of treaties and appointments may give extra support to the Senate.</li>
<li>The additonal expense from the establishment of the new Constitution are much fewer than may have been imagined.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Summary II: Anti-Federalist Papers</h3>
<p>The Anti-Federalists were not interested in a centralized nation.</p>
<ol>
<li>Which form of government (a large national republic or a confederation of small republics) is more likely to preserve and protect personal liberties and why?</li>
<li>Can a larger republic, based on the principle of consent of the governed, sufficiently protect the rights and liberties of the individual states and people, or is a confederation the only method of securing such liberty?</li>
<li>Should the federal legislature be able to repeal state laws in order to impose federal laws for the purpose of promoting the general welfare or common defense of the nation? If so, why? If not, why?</li>
<li>Brutus argues that in a republic, “the manners, sentiments, and interests of the people should be similar…if not, there will be a constant clashing of opinions and the representatives of one part will be constantly striving against the other.”Should a republic be made up of a small group of like-minded people? Or, is diversity of opinion beneficial to the success of a federal government?</li>
</ol>
<p>The government under the Article of Confederation was not strong enough to manage some of the problems that the nation has experienced.<br />
The Constitution written by the convention in Philadelphia is an attempt to solve those problems.<br />
If the new form of government is a good one, many generations of people will be able to enjoy all the blessings of liberty, the nation will grow and prosper, and people will advance in knowledge and virtue.<br />
If the new government leads to a loss of liberty, then America, the place where liberty has the best chance to succeed, will fail and future generation will blame and despise us.<br />
The people must be careful about parting with power  (as in creating a strong central government) because they are unlikely to ever get it back.<br />
In the confederation government (as in the Articles of Confederation), most of the powers belongs to the states. In a consolidated government (as in the 1787 Constitution) most of the power belongs to the central, or national government.<br />
The new constitution places so much power in a central government that the state government may no longer be able to function as republics under the control of their citizens.<br />
The “necessary and proper” clause and the “supreme law of the land” clause make the central government an uncontrollable power over the topics that the Constitution covers.<br />
It is true that the constitution lists certain enumerated powers that will belong to the central government, reserving some minor power to the states, but all the important powers are delegated to the central government.<br />
There is no practical limit to the national legislature's power to tax because the legislature itself decides what is meant by “common defense” and “general welfare”<br />
The authority to tax is the most important power a government can be given because it is related to all other powers that governments can have.<br />
Federal courts will destroy the state courts.<br />
The legislature has broad powers with few limits; the necessary and proper clause invalidates any limits and may result in destroying the state governments.<br />
It is human nature that those who have power try to increase it, and the central government will keep growing until all state authority is eliminated.<br />
In such a large country it will be too hard for the representatives to really know the minds of the people. Writings from history help prove this point.<br />
History furnishes no example of a free republic, anything like the extent of the United States.<br />
In a free republic, people declare their consent through representatives, who are supposed to know the minds of their constituents.<br />
The territory of the United States is of vast extent that it is not practicable to elect a representation that will speak their sentiments.<br />
The diverse interest in a large republic will continually argue against each other.<br />
(Europe) Standing armies in peacetime are a danger to liberty.<br />
A free republic does not need a standing army to enforce its laws.Because of all these problems, the people will have little confidence in their legislature and will not support the laws it passes.<br />
The legislature cannot be large enough to be truly representative of the people’s interests.<br />
Representatives elected in such a large republic would soon beyond control by the people and abuse their power for selfish and corrupt purpose.<br />
Powerful elective officers will attract ambitious and sneaky men who are likely to abuse their power.</p>
