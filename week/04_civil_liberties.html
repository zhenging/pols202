<p><strong>Civil rights</strong>: The limits placed on government so that people can freely exercise their rights.</p>
<h3>The Rise of Civil Liberties</h3>
<h4>Civil Rights and Civil Liberties</h4>
<p>Civil Rights and liberties demand <strong>opposite</strong> things from government. Civil rights <strong>require</strong> government action to help secure individual rights; civil liberties <strong>restrict</strong> government action to protect individual rights..</p>
<h4>The Slow Rise of Rights</h4>
<ul>
<li><em>Selective incorporation</em>. Extending protection from the Bill of Rights to the state government, one right at a time.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Privacy</h3>
<h4>Penumbras and Emanations</h4>
<p>How could the Court protect privacy if the Constitution does not even mention it?</p>
<ul>
<li>in the Bill of Rights &quot;have penumbras ...&quot; that give them life and substance.</li>
<li>The <em>penumbras</em> - literally, the shadows - of the First Amendments create &quot;zone of privacy&quot; in which people have a right to make their own choices from government interference. So do the &quot;emanations&quot; from other amendmentss. such as the Third Amendment's ban on quartering soliders in private homes</li>
</ul>
<h4>Roe v. Wade</h4>
<h4>Planned Parenthood v. Casey</h4>
<h4>Sexuality Beteen Consenting Adults</h4>
<h3>Freedom of Religion</h3>
<p>The First Amendment gives two succinct commands regulating religion. The federal government may not establish an official religion-known as the <strong>establishment clause</strong>. And it may not interfere in the religious practice-the <strong>free exercise clause</strong>.</p>
<h4>Establishment Clause</h4>
<h4>Free Exercise Clause</h4>
<h3>Freedom of Speech</h3>
<h3>Freedom of the Press</h3>
<h3>The Right to Bear Arms</h3>
<h3>The Rights of the Accused</h3>
<h3>Fightling Terrorism and Protecting Liberty</h3>
<h3>Conclusion: The Dilemma of Civil Liberties</h3>
