<p>The first Americna form of government was the <em>Articles of Confederation</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Second Article - Each state retains its sovereignty</li>
<li>Third Article - States severally enter into a firm league of friendship with each other.</li>
</ul>
<p>In a Confederation, political power is decentralized because the central government is weak and the state or regional governments are strong. The Articles has five major defects:<br />
1. <em>Taxing</em>. The national government did not have the power to tax.<br />
2. <em>Executive</em>. No executive branch, no judical branch. A representative body had the most power.<br />
3. <em>Commerce</em>. Discriminateing out of state or foreign business interests.<br />
4. <em>Amendment</em>. Unanimous consent is difficult to archieve.<br />
5. <em>Domestic Order</em>. Ineffectual response to domestic disturbances such as Shay's Rebellion and secessionist movement.</p>

</ul>
<h5>2.51 The Three Functions of the Constitution</h5>

<h3>Lecture - Articles of Confederate &amp; Compromises at the Constitution</h3>
<p><strong>Primary Goal</strong>: Describe the origin and development of the Constitution.</p>
<h5>A Constitutional Convention is Called</h5>
<p>The Dilemma:<br />
1. The fear of government being too strong. (power abuse by the British Crown)<br />
2. The concerns of government being too week. (Shays’s Rebellion)</p>
<h5>Constitutional Debates:</h5>
<ul>
<li>National Government Power vs. State Government Power Debate</li>
<li>Representation in the Legislature Debate: Big States vs Small States</li>
<li><strong>Virginia Plan</strong> (Big States)
<ul>
<li>Three branches of government. Legislative branch made laws, the Executive Branch enforced the laws, and the Judicial branch would interpret laws</li>
<li>A two-house legislature with the lower house elected directly by the people and the upper house selected by the lower;</li>
<li>Representation in both houses was based on a state’s population or wealth;</li>
<li>An executive elected by Congress (this is the parliamentary system found in the UK); a national judiciary; and congressional veto over state laws.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>New Jersey Plan</strong> (Small States)
<ul>
<li>A unicameral (one-house) Congress in which each state had an equal vote, and called for Congress to have the powers of taxation and regulation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The Great Compromises</strong>
<ul>
<li>To satisfy the smaller states, each state had an equal number of votes in the Senate.</li>
<li>To satisfy the larger states, votes in the House of Reps is based on population.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h5>The Presidency Debates</h5>
<h5>The Electoral College</h5>
<ul>
<li>Option 1 Problem: state legislatures could not put aside their own narrow concerns and think about the national interest</li>
<li>Option 2 Problem: the average citizen would not be informed enough or have enough wisdom of government to choose wisely.</li>
</ul>
