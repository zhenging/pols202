<p>2. Understand the power problem and what is the relationship between the power problem, government, and police?</p>
<p>3. Many political questions about the right size and proper role of government are actually questions about whether a political system is a just system. While Justice as a concept, is hard to precisely define, let’s make an attempt. Offer a discussion of how one can define and discuss juice.</p>
<p>4. What is liberty? Understand how the debate of liberty is framed. Understand the differences between plosive and negave liberty. Is it possible—or even a good thing—to have one without the other?</p>
<p>5. Understand the clash between the criticism of modern government and government as necessary. What are the criteria for determining whether government provides a good or service rather than having it provided by the private sector? (Market Failures)</p>
<p>6. What is Political Science and how has it evolved from its historical roots to its more modern form?</p>
<p>7. Government and politics are concerned with values. Understand some of the most important political values reviewed in the lecture (personal liberty, social order, juice, equality.)</p>
<p>8. Compare and contrast the the noons of <strong>political power, authority, and legitimacy</strong>. Include an understanding of Max Weber’s three types of authority.</p>
<p>9. Compare and contrast the theorists/philosophers as reviewed in the lecture and readings. Which do you align with more and why?</p>
<p>10. Compare and contrast the forms of government as presented in the readings (Monarchy/Autocracy; Aristocracy/Oligarchy; Democracy). Discuss how the U.S. system was intended to be a mixed form of government and understand examples of this mixed form.</p>
<p>11. Know and understand the roots of American thinking about democracy. Discuss what a republic truly is and compare a republic with a democracy. Explain the relationship between a democracy and a republic in American government. Discuss contemporary examples of how these two principles can be seen in America's Democratic-Republic.</p>
