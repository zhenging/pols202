### WEEK 12

**Objective**: This week we will examine how voting, elections, and campaigns organize participation in politics and government in order to solve the problems that people expect government to solve. Next week we will look more closely at the role of interest groups and examine the question of whether interest groups help or hinder Democracy. By completing the following lectures, readings and assignments, you will better understand how self-government requires the participation of an active and engaged citizenry.
