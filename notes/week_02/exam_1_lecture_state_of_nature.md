+ Using the lecture material chose one of the following prompts for your Discussion Write-up

##### Hobbes
> When Hobbes was born in England in 1588, the Spanish Armada was about to invade England. The beginning of life in a state of fear influenced Hobbes’ thinking. The English revolution of the 17th century also inspired Hobbes into arguing that absolute rule by a sovereign was the only way to ensure peace and prosperity. During the English civil war (1642-1651), King Charles was beheaded.
In his understandings of the state of nature, Hobbes thought humans are naturally egotistical, competitive, and brutal, and “are not guided by reason and moral ideals but by animistic instincts, a ruthless struggle for self-preservation, and a perpetual and restless desire for power (Hall, 6).”
In Hobbes’s theory of social contract, Hobbes used natural law to justify a strong centralized government, one immune to civil war, with virtually no religious references at all. He likened the Livathen to a government, a powerful state created to impose order. He further explained that, “as part of this contract all agree to something akin to the gold run - do not that to another which you would not have done to yourself (Hall 6).”  The contract allows the use of coercive force by the sovereign to ensure compliance.

2\. Discuss why Hobbes believe the best form of government had an absolute and irrevocable sovereign. How did Hobbes view the church's relationship to government and what historical event may have influenced this view?
> 1\. Human are not guided by reason and moral ideals but by animistic instincts, a ruthless struggle for self-preservation, and a "perpetual and restless desire" for power.

##### Locke
3\. What significant historical event occurred prior to Locke’s writing of Two Treatises compared to what occurred in Hobbes's lifetime and how did this event affect Locke’s thinking on the role of government?
> He was 56 years old during the Glorious Revolution (1689) and witnessed a newly crowned king sign an English Bill of Rights and a rational negotiation between a parliament and king.

4\. Although Locke in Two Treatises of Government agreed with Hobbes about the necessity of a social contract in a brutish state of nature, what were his disagreements regarding man’s natural rights and the operation of the social contract? How did he view the power of the King?
> According to Locke, the natural rights of individuals limited the power of the king. The king did bot hole absolute power, but acted only to enforce and protect the natural rights of the people.

5\. What were Locke’s views on property and its relationship to government?
> 1\. Locke, argued that natural rights such as life, liberty, and property existed in the state of nature and could never be taken away or even voluntarily given up by individuals. These rights are "inalienable".
2\. He believed property to be the most important natural right.
