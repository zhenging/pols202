Why Politics Why Government - Lenz & Holman

#### 1.0 What is Government?
In the US, government includes the national government institution (Congress, the Presidency, the federal courts, and a broad range of courts), the 50 state government (state legislatures, governors, state courts, and state bureaucracies), and the local government(counties, cities, and other special government units such as school boards).

1.10 Why Government?
+ One recurring theme in American government and politics is the conflict between two basic values: **freedom** and **order**.
+ In the U.S., **freedom** of religion, speech, press, and association are individual liberties that are guaranteed by the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.
+ One of the primary responsibilities of government is to create and maintain good public order. Good public order is commonly defined to include public safety (individuals are protected from crime, foreign invasions, and domestic disturbances) as well as behavior that a society considers appropriate conduct

1.12 The Power Problem
+ The **power problem** refers to the need to grant government enough power to effectively address the problems that people expect government to address, while also limiting power enough so that government can be held accountable.
+ Politics is about reconciling individual, ideological, and partisan differences of opinion about the power problem.

1.13 Politics
+ People have different opinions about whether their political system, or the political system of another country, allows too much indiividual freedom or provides too little public order. (The U.S. Constitution does not say very much about the specifics of where to strike the balance between rights and powers).
+ Political opinions about the right balance between individual rights and government power are influenced by conditions. (Is it a time of war or peace? ...)
+ American politics is often framed as debates about the size of government. These debates are familiar arguments about big government versus small government.

1.14 Justice
+ Politically, justice usually means that an individual is treated fairly by the government.
+ Justice is important politically because it describes a proper ordering of things, values, and individuals within a society.
+ The interest in justice was not limited to the founding era. (the North fough against slavery during Civil War, civile rights movement of 20th cnetury for achivee a more just society for Blacks, women, and other minorities)
+ In the sense of a person's expectation, justice is an expectation that a person will get what they deserve—whether it is recognition and reward for doing well and behaving appropriately, or sanctions for not doing well or behaving inappropriately.
+ Different Types of Justice.
  + _Retributive Justice_ is concerned with proper response to wrongdoing. (criminal justice system, practice of punishment)
  + _Restorative Justice_ emphasizes the importance of restoring the victim and rehibilitating the offender.
  + _Distributive Justice_ is concerned with the proper distribution of values or valuables among the individual or groups in a society. (Income, wealth, food, health care, tax break, or property). (Who gets what and who should be getting what.)

#### 1.2 The State of Nature: Life Before or without Government
+ The state of Nature is used to explain the origin of government.
+ All ideologies include a view of human nature. Some ideologies are based on negative view of human nature and some are based on a more positive view of human nature.

1.21 John Locke
+ The naturel state of man is to live free from oppresion and the will of man.
+ The use of power or might without right—the fear that might makes right—is one reason why individuals decide to leave the state of nature and live under government.

1.22 Jean-Jacques Rousseau
+ "Man is born free, and everywhere he is in chains.”"
+ Life without government in a “state of nature” created problems or conditions that caused individuals to believe that living withgovernment would be an improvement.

1.23 Influence on the American Founders
+ John Locke believed that individuals decided to leave the state of nature and live under government because government offered greater protection of their rights including the right to life, liberty, and property.
+ Natural rights are not created by human beings or government. Natural rights
contrast with positive rights, which are created by an act of government.

1.24 The Social Contract Theory of Government
+ Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, are classical political philosophers who are social contractarians. They advocate a social contract theory that provides a justification for creating government and operating it as acts of self-government. (The people have a duty to obey the law. The government has a responsibility to provide safe streets, national security, and other public goods. )
+ Social contract theory is identified with self-government because it is based on popular sovereignty.
+ John Stuart Mill. Harm Principle (considered libertarian)
+ John Rawls. People create governments because they believe that life under government will more just, fairer, than life without government.
+ The idea of government based on a social contract has an especially strong appeal in the U.S. (colonial experience - Mayflower Compact, founding experience - Constitution)

#### 1.3 Modern Government
+ **Anarchism** is the political philosophy that believes government is unnecessary and that government power is illegitimate because it is based on force or compulsion.
+  The widespread acceptance of government as necessary—or at least a necessary
evil—does not mean there is consensus on the _size_ and _role_ of government.

1.31 Market Failures
One reason for **government intervention** in the market is when there is a market failure. The following aspects of market failures are discussed below: public goods, monopolies, externalities, information asymmetries, and equity.
+ _Public Good_ is one that, once provided, cannot be limited to those who have paid for it.
+ _Externalities_. An externality occurs when a market transaction affects individuals who are not a party to the transaction. Negative (pollution), positive (education, vaccination, and crime control)
+ _Monopoliess_
+ _Equity_

#### 1.4 Why Politics
Politics occurs in families, religious organizations, educational institutions, organized sports and entertainment, and the workplace.

1.41 What is Politics?
+ Authoritative allocation of values for a society. (Material and Spiritual Values)
+ Politics includes government actions or policies
  + that subsidize certain behaviors or values that are considered desirable and worthy of support in order to promote them. (Marriage, child rearing, education)
  + that are considered undesirable in order to control them or to discourage them: (idleness, smoking, consumption of alcohol, gambling)
  + that prohibit certain behaviors or values by making them illegal: for example, drug usage; prostitution; or hate crimes
+ Process politics. (campaigns, elections, lobbying)

1.42 What is Political Science?
Political Science is the branch of the social sciences (e.g., economics, sociology) that systematically studies the theory and practice of government.

#### 1.5 Political Values
1.51 Personal liberty (Individual Freedom)
1.52 Social Order
1.53 Justice
1.54 Equality
1.55 Political Power, Authority, and Legitimacy
+ **Power** can be defined as the ability to make another person to do what you want, to force others to do what you want.
+ **Authority** can be defined as the right to make other people do what you want. (Traditional, charismatic, rational)
+ **Legitimacy** refers to the appropriate ability to make others do what you want, the legal right to make others comply with demands

#### 1.6 Citizenship
A citizen is a member of the political community

#### 1.7 The Forms of Government
| Form     | Good Variation | Bad Variation |
|----------|----------------|---------------|
|The One   | Monarchy       | Tyranny/Autocracy |
|The Few   | Monarchy       | Oligarchy (rich or powerful) |
|The Many  | Polity/Democracy | Democracy (Tyranny of majority) |
+ The U.S. system of government was intended by its founders to be a mixed form of government because it includes elements of all three forms: _monarchy_ (the presidency); _aristocracy_ (the Senate, the Electoral College, and the Supreme Court); and _democracy_ (the House of Representatives; elections).
+ The system of checks and balances was designed to create a political system where institutions and political organizations provided a measure of protection against corruption and abuse of power.
+ The Founders believed the power problem of corruption could be avoided by dividing power so that no one person or institution had complete power.
+ The United States is a republic. A republic is a _representative democracy_.
+ In a republic, individuals do not directly govern themselves. Voters elect
representatives who, as government officials, make laws for the people. This contrasts with a direct democracy, where voters choose public policies themselves.

#### 1.8 Summary: Why Government and Politics
Government and politics occur almost everywhere because they are one of the ways that individuals organize themselves to achieve individual goals such as wealth, public safety, and education
