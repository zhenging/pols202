### Prompt #2: A State of Nature
1\. What significant historical even occurred prior to Thomas Hobbes' writing of Leviathan? Explain what Hobbes meant by the "state of nature" and by "social contract"?

#### Part 1: Response
When Hobbes was born in England in 1588, the Spanish Armada was about to invade England. The beginning of life in a state of fear influenced Hobbes’ thinking. The English revolution of the 17th century also inspired Hobbes into arguing that absolute rule by a sovereign was the only way to ensure peace and prosperity. During the English civil war (1642-1651), King Charles was beheaded.
In his understandings of the state of nature, Hobbes thought humans are naturally egotistical, competitive, and brutal, and “are not guided by reason and moral ideals but by animistic instincts, a ruthless struggle for self-preservation, and a perpetual and restless desire for power (Hall, 6).”
In Hobbes’s theory of social contract, Hobbes used natural law to justify a strong centralized government, one immune to civil war, with virtually no religious references at all. He likened the Livathen to a government, a powerful state created to impose order. He further explained that, “as part of this contract all agree to something akin to the gold run - do not that to another which you would not have done to yourself (Hall 6).”  The contract allows the use of coercive force by the sovereign to ensure compliance.

North Korea is considered to be a typical autocracy because its government is controlled by a single autocratic dictator with unchecked power. In North Korea, ordinary people have little or no freedom of speaking ideas other than those in state media’s propaganda. Because no one can hold the ruler Kim Jong-un account for his action, he literally does whatever he desires to gain political and financial interests.  The news says that North Korea succeeded in launching missile over Japan and was ready to carry out military operation over the American territory of Guam. Such action was a great example of unchecked powered exerted by an absolute dictator.
