Segment 1: The Battle Over Crusader - Military Defense Contracts (1min-9min)
Discussion Forum Question: Explain why members of Congress come to the defense of United Defense. What tactics did United Defense use to fend off efforts to kill the Crusader. What was the end result - was United Defense successful? How was the "iron triangle" used in this example.

#### Part 1: Response
Upon the Secretary of Defense's decision to end the Crusader program, the contractor of the Crusader program - United Defense started a fight to keep it going. The fight featured many aspects of how an interest group works to push its own agenda.
According to Morone and Kersh, an interest group is defined as an organization whose goal is to influence government(MK, p.285). In the batter over the Crusader, the interest group formed a cozy relationship called iron-triangle, which comprised the army, the United Defense and members of congress in whose districts they would benefit from the production of the Crusader system. The arm wanted to promote its combat capability, the United Defense wanted to keep the contract for financial interest and the members of congress stood for the system to benefit their own distrcts throught the production of the system. This interest group employed a series of strategies in the battle.
First, the army leaked the news of termination of Crusader to the United Defense, so United Defense could move ahead (Informing Members). Second, they hired lobbyists to communicate members' view. In this case, lobbist contacted congress members of interest. Third, the group also mobilized the public by raising the awareness that the decision was unfair and unjust without debate.
Last, the United Defense further formed coalition with 200 plus contractors related to Crusader through the PR firm it hired.

Big Oil Cheers Quietly as Trump Moves to Ease Auto Standards

In a report from Bloomberg, Trump's administration proposed to relax fuel-econonmy and vehicle pollution standards, which could be a favor to US oil producers. The proposal would translate to an increase in oil consumption. The group behind the proposal is the oil industry who strives to archieve greater economic interest. They hired the American Petroleum Institute for lobbying to influence the government's policy on those standards and argued that the Obama-era standards are outdated. The group's campaigns included putting out Facebooks ads featuring President Trump's support for the ease, fighting in statehouses, helping drafting legislation, etc.
