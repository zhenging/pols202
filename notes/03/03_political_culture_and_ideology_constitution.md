The first American form of government was the _Articles of Confederation_.

In a Confederation, political power is decentralized because the central government is weak and the state or regional governments are strong. The Articles has five major defects:
1\. _Taxing_. The national government did not have the power to tax.
2\. _Executive_. No executive branch, no judicial branch. A representative body had the most power.
3\. _Commerce_. Discriminating out of state or foreign business interests.
4\. _Amendment_. Unanimous consent is difficult to achieve.
5\. _Domestic Order_. Ineffectual response to domestic disturbances such as Shay's Rebellion and secessionist movement.

  + Three branches of government. Legislative branch made laws, the Executive Branch enforced the laws, and the Judicial branch would interpret laws
  + A two-house legislature with the lower house elected directly by the people and the upper house selected by the lower;
  + Representation in both houses was based on a state's population or wealth;
  + An executive elected by Congress (this is the parliamentary system found in the UK); a national judiciary; and congressional veto over state laws.
+ **New Jersey Plan** (Small States)
  + A unicameral (one-house) Congress in which each state had an equal vote, and called for Congress to have the powers of taxation and regulation.

  + To satisfy the larger states, votes in the House of Reps is based on population.
