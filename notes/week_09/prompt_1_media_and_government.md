### Prompt #1: Media & Government
1\. Describe the three essential functions Media outlets perform in a democracy. Discuss the paradox of media. Is it easy to alter public attitudes? Why or why not?

#### Part 1: Response
Media outlets perform three essential functions in a democratic system: providing information, acting as a public watchdog, and helping shape the political agenda. (MK, 224)
**First**, media coverage informs the public.
1\. Most of all can not get first hand news from political event and keep track policy issues and public problems. Media help bridge the gap, so we are more informed and engaged citizens.
2\. News item can have an impact on people who have not yet made up their minds.
**Second**, the media serves as a public watchdog. It scrutinizes government (and business) for corruption, crime, lies, misleading statement, dangerous products, and other flaws.
**Third**, editors and reports have enormous influence on what Americans think about.
1\. Media executives listen to the political din and pluck one or two stories to headline and a dozen other for the second tier. Those then become the topics that politicians address, Congress investigate, talk shows debate.
2\. When the media focuses on an issue, its importance or salience generally rise in the public perception.
3\. Those issues that rise onto the agenda and dominate the news affect public perception of candidate.
4\. There are many ways to cover an issue, and each offers a slightly different perspective.
The **paradox of media** is that the new media is most likely to influence the people who pay the least attention to it. Because the group does not follow politics and government very closely, only news stories with a loud signal are likely to reach them and influence their views.

Trump launches another attack on the media, says press are 'dangerous and sick' and can 'cause war'
https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/05/trump-steps-up-his-media-feud-saying-press-are-dangerous-and-sick.html
In a report from CNBC, President Trump again unleashed a new broadside against journalists as "dangerous and sick". In one tweet, the president tweeted, "The Fake News hates me saying that they are the Enemy of the People" only because they know it's True...". The president has been easily irritated by news reports that are not in his favor. However, it is the responsibility of media that serves as a public watchdog to scrutinized government for any flaws. As the president of the United State, Mr Trump is obliged to accept such scrutiny. His anti-press rhetoric is troublesome and could erode the U.S. commitment to free speech.
