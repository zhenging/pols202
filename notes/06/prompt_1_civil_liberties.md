### Prompt #1: Civil Liberties
5.\ Why are some rights, such as speech, sometimes limited? What are the tests for the limitations of some of these rights? Are these hard-and-fast "tests"? In what situations may government prohibit free speech? What role do the components of the obscenity test play in free speech?

#### Part 1: Response
Though the right of free speech has been given a preferred position, meaning "when freedom of speech conflicts with any other right, the court generally will prefer to protect speech."(By the people, p120), there are limits and boundaries regarding the right to speech. The limits include:
There are fighting words that were not protected by the Constitution. The key test is that the language does not advance any specific political position.
Student speech in campus is less protected by the First Amendment, as school officials may regulate speech as long as they do not do so arbitrarily.
For political speech, the clear and present danger test is used. During the test, whether the natural tendency and probable effect of the speech was to "bring about something bad or evil"-even if that danger lay in the distant future, is determined. The clear and present danger test stood for decades. However, regarding the Brandenburg v. Ohio case, the Supreme Court rewrote the test. The state may not interfere with speech unless the speech "incites imminent lawless action" and is likely to actually "product such action".
Obscenity is one category of speech unprotected by the First Amendment. The Supreme Court created a three-part-test (Miller test )for judging a work to be obscene. However, the Mill test arose a lot of new questions. Under the test, it is extremely difficult to ban material as obscene.

Trump vows to sign an executive order requiring colleges to 'support free speech'
https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/02/politics/trump-executive-order-colleges-free-speech/index.html
In part of a two-hour long speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference in National Hahor, Trump vowed to sign an executive order requiring college and universities to support free speech in order to be eligible for federal research dollars. In his speech, he mention Hayden Williams, a field representative of a conservative group, was punched in the face while recruiting students in UC Berkeley campus. It seemed that the UC Berkeley's support for free speech was questionable. However, it turned out neither Hayden nor the assailant were affiliated with the university. Despite the incident, there are no opposition nor disruption to the talks hosted by conservative student groups in campus. We can see that some news outlets has distorted the story, which implicated UC Berkeley's commitment to freedom of speech.
