Chapter 4: Civil Liberties

**Civil rights**: The limits placed on government so that people can freely exercise their rights.

### The Rise of Civil Liberties

#### Civil Rights and Civil Liberties
Civil Rights and liberties demand **opposite** things from government. Civil rights **require** government action to help secure individual rights; civil liberties **restrict** government action to protect individual rights..

#### The Slow Rise of Rights
+ _Selective incorporation_. Extending protection from the Bill of Rights to the state government, one right at a time.

### Privacy

#### Penumbras and Emanations
How could the Court protect privacy if the Constitution does not even mention it?
+ in the Bill of Rights "have penumbras ..." that give them life and substance.
+ The _penumbras_ - literally, the shadows - of the First Amendments create "zone of privacy" in which people have a right to make their own choices from government interference. So do the "emanations" from other amendmentss. such as the Third Amendment's ban on quartering soliders in private homes

#### Roe v. Wade

#### Planned Parenthood v. Casey

#### Sexuality Beteen Consenting Adults

### Freedom of Religion
The First Amendment gives two succinct commands regulating religion. The federal government may not establish an official religion-known as the **establishment clause**. And it may not interfere in the religious practice-the **free exercise clause**.

#### Establishment Clause
+ **Strict seperation**: The strict principles articulated in the _Lemon test_ for judging whether a law establishes a religion.
+ **Acommodation**: The principle that government does not violate the establishment clause as long as it does not confer an advantage to some religion over others.

#### Free Exercise Clause
_neutrality test_
_Sherbert or balancing test_

### Freedom of Speech
The First Amendment states: _Congress shall make no laws ... abridging the freedom of speech or of the press._

#### A Preferrred Position
+ The Supreme Court givers the First Amendment a "prefered position" among all the amendments to the Constitution.
+ Among the rights listed in the First Amendment(free speech, religion, press, assembly, and the right to petition government), free speech holds a "prefered position."
+ Democracy requires vigorous debate. As a resultm the courts will be skeptical of any effort to curb speech.

#### Political Speech
+ [_Schencks v. United State, 1919_](https://www.oyez.org/cases/1900-1940/249us47).
  * Speech is not protected if it poses a "*clear and present danger*" that it will lead to substantive evil.
  * The Court held that the Espionage Act did not violate the First Amendment and was an appropriate exercise of Congressâ€™ wartime authority.
  * **Clear and present danger**. Court doctrine that permits restrictions of free speech if officials believe that the speech will lead to prohibited action such as violence or terrorism.

+ [_Branndenburg v. Ohio (1969)_](https://www.oyez.org/cases/1968/492).
  * The Court's Per Curiam opinion held that the Ohio law violated Brandenburg's right to free speech.

#### Symbolic Speech
**Symbolic Speech**: An act, rather than actual speech, used to demonstrate a point of view.

E.g. KKK Leader Clarence Brandenburg burned his cross.

#### Limits to Free Speech: Fighting Words
+ **Fighting words**: Expressions inherently likely to provoke violent reaction and not necessarily protected by the First Amendment.
+ **Hate Speech**: Hostile statements based on someone's personal characteristics, such as race, ethnicity, religion, or sexual orientation.

#### Limited Protections: Student Speech
+ [Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District](https://www.oyez.org/cases/1968/21)
  * The Supreme Court overturned the suspension and established what became knowns as the Tinker Rule: The students' right to free speech could be curtailed only if it "materially and substantially" interferes with the requirements of appropriate discipline in the operation of the school.

+ [Morse v. Frederick](https://www.oyez.org/cases/2006/06-278)
  * The First Amendment offers students-in high schools or colleges-less protection than adults. School officials may regulate speech as long as they do not do so arbitrarily.

### Freedom of the Press

#### Prior Restraint
+ Prior Restraint: Legal effort to stop speech before it occurs-in effect, censorship.
+ Obscenity
+ Libel (written falsehood are known as _libel_, spoken falsehood are known as _slander_)

### The Right to Bear Arms
+ A Relic of the Revolution

### The Rights of the Accused
### Fightling Terrorism and Protecting Liberty

### Conclusion: The Dilemma of Civil Liberties
