### 03 Political Culture and Ideology; Compromises at the Constitution

#### Political Culture and Ideology

#### Lecture - Articles of Confederate & Compromises at the Constitution

**Primary Goal**: Describe the origin and development of the Constitution.

##### Articles of Confederation
+ A congress was to be the chief agency of government. No executive branch, no judical branch.
+ Under the Articles, congress was severely constrained. Power resided in the states rather than a national government.
  + Financial instability. (conflicting laws regarding tarifff by each state)
  + Shays’s Rebellion

##### A Constitutional Convention is Called
The Dilemma:
1\. The fear of government being too strong. (power abuse by the British Crown)
2\. The concerns of government being too week. (Shays’s Rebellion)

##### Constitutional Debates:
+ National Government Power vs. State Government Power Debate
+ Representation in the Legislature Debate: Big States vs Small States
+ **Virginia Plan** (Big States)
  + Three branches of government. Legislative branch made laws, the Executive Branch enforced the laws, and the Judicial branch would interpret laws
  + A two-house legislature with the lower house elected directly by the people and the upper house selected by the lower;
  + Representation in both houses was based on a state’s population or wealth;
  + An executive elected by Congress (this is the parliamentary system found in the UK); a national judiciary; and congressional veto over state laws.
+ **New Jersey Plan** (Small States)
  + A unicameral (one-house) Congress in which each state had an equal vote, and called for Congress to have the powers of taxation and regulation.
+ **The Great Compromises**
  + To satisfy the smaller states, each state had an equal number of votes in the Senate.
  + To satisfy the larger states, votes in the House of Reps is based on population.

##### The Presidency Debates

##### The Electoral College
+ Option 1 Problem: state legislatures could not put aside their own narrow concerns and think about the national interest
+ Option 2 Problem: the average citizen would not be informed enough or have enough wisdom of government to choose wisely.
