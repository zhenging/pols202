<p>Take note that our course officially ends Friday. Cuesta tech admin shuts down Canvas Friday at 11:59pm. I am not given the admin rights to override this. All work must be submitted by 11:59pm Friday.</p>
<h4>Assignments for the Week:</h4>
<p><strong>Final Exam #6 WILL OPEN WEDNESDAY.</strong></p>
<h5>Part 1: multiple choice objective</h5>
<p>The multiple choice portion of the exam covers assigned readings from our course text Morone and Kersh, By the People, sections on The Bureaucracy &amp; The Judicial Branch. This objective part is not comprehensive. It is STRONGLY suggested that before beginning this exam you work through the study guides to prepare you for the topics covered in the exam.</p>
<ul>
<li>There are 30 questions made up of multiple choice, true/false, and matching.</li>
<li>This exam is timed. You have 60 minutes to complete 30 questions. Once you begin, you need to finish in one sitting, within 60 minutes. The system does not offer a 2nd attempt.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Part 2: short answer written response (3 paragraphs)</h5>
<p>The written response prompts focus on <strong>material presented in lecture and the film interview</strong> with the supreme court justices. It is STRONGLY suggested that before beginning this exam you look carefully at the study guide page 2, where I offer specific guiding questions to prepare you for this short essay exam. Good exam practice is to draft outlines for possible prompts so you are ready to focus on a final draft in the 60 minutes provided.</p>
<ul>
<li>Part 2 requires a written response. This exam is timed.<br />
You have 60 minutes to address the short essay prompt. Once you begin, you need to finish in one sitting, within 60 minutes.</li>
<li>You will NOT be able to upload a doc. However, you CAN copy and paste in any draft you compose in a word processing program (google docs, word etc.) This is suggested.</li>
