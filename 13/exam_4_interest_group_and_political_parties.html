<p>2. Compare and contrast the three theories that speak to the effects of interest groups in a democracy. What does pluralism imply? What do hyperpluralists fear? What does power elite theory imply?  Which has broader explanatory capacity and/or seems most persuasive?</p>
<p>3. Compare and contrast Economic Interest Groups, Citizen or Public Interest Groups, and Intergovernmental Groups. What is meant by reverse lobbying? Are these practices common today?</p>
<p>4. Elaborate on the multiple roles played by lobbyists working in the nation’s capital. Describe the traditional “iron triangle” and its the three actors. What are issue networks and how do they compare to iron triangles?</p>
<p>5. Make two cases: 1. a case for why interest group involvement in the policymaking process is a bad thing or a negative; 2. make a case for why interest group involvement in the policymaking process is a good thing or a positive.</p>
<p>6. Compare and contrast a two-party political system with a multiparty political system. Discuss the pros and cons of America’s two-party dominance.</p>
<p>7. What obstacles do third party political parties face in the United States? Discuss who won the presidential election of 2000 and discuss the significance as it relates to third party candidates How can third party candidates influence non-national elections?</p>
<p>8. Compare and contrast the first party system (Beginnings 1789-1828) the second party system (Rise c. 1828 –1860) and the third party system including party machines and party bosses (War &amp; Reconstruction 1860-1896)</p>
<p>9. Compare and contrast the fourth party system (Business &amp; Reform 1896-1932) the fifth party  system (Depression &amp; New Deal 1933-1968) and sixth party system (Parties at Equal Strength 1972-Present).</p>
<p>10. What are the DNC and RNC and what function do they perform? Discuss the party platform, party in government &amp; party in the electorate.</p>
<p>11. Why are the two major political parties in the United States considered “big tent” parties? Within this context discuss the fall and then the rise of parties and partisanship. What is meant by the term divided government?</p>
<p>12. Has the United States grown too partisan? or does democracy need parties to flesh out and debate the merit of ideas? Or do both sides have merit? (Morone and Kersh lay out nice arguments for this on pp. 316-318)</p>
